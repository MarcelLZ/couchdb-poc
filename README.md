## ‚öôÔ∏è Running and testing

As always, clone the project, run `yarn`to install all dependencies (*or npm*) inside project folder and then `yarn dev`.
As you can see, the project is using a **ec2** instance to run *couchdb* database.

Open two browser tabs and change product name in one of them. See the magic happens! CouchDB will automatically change data in
all connected clients.
